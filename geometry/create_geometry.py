File used to generate a NGSolve geometry object

In this file, four methods are defined to create a NGSolve geometry object:
  1) parametric_geometry      -- Given parametric curves, use these curves as a boundary
  2) parametric_wall_geometry -- Given two parametric wall curves, use these curves as wall boundary and automatically generate the sea and river boundaries
  3) general_spline_geometry  -- Given boundary points, fit a spline and use it as a boundary
  4) general_spline3_geometry -- Given boundary points, fit a spline, create smaller NGSolve spline3 curves and use these as boundary

TODO make an object of this script, such that we can more easily work with its properties
